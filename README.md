This website asks the user to enter a date in order to display the NASA picture or video of the day.

## How It's Made

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

I used HTML and CSS to display centered images/videos at an appropriate width to the user's screen. The JavaScript used a fetch() method to make a request to the server and load the data onto the webpage. A conditional was also used to evaluate whether the media type received was an image or video, which helped determine how it would be displayed to the user. 

## Optimizations

I would deploy the project to a website and clear out the images and iframes on each load for improved functionality.

## Lessons Learned

I researched NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day API documentation and used a fetch request to have the picture or video of the day appear for the user with a corresponding explanation.
